# Discriminative-Sparse-Feature-Selection-for-Multi-class-Classification
In today’s world, many real-world machine learning applications such as text categorization, face recognition, handwritten digit recognition, and gene detection involve the use of high-dimensional data. These datasets suffer from the ”curse of dimensionality,” as they often contain many features that are irrelevant or redundant, leading to increased computational complexity and degraded model performance.
In this project, we tackle the problem of multi-class feature selection (MFS), where the goal is to select the most relevant and discriminative features that enhances classification accuracy across multiple classes.
The project addresses multi-class feature selection (MFS) by implementing a novel framework: the Sparse Softmax Feature Selection (S2FS) method. S2FS combines Softmax classification with L2,0 norm regularization to enforce exact sparsity and adds a discriminative regularization based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Together, these elements allow for selecting highly discriminative and uncorrelated features, leading to improved multi-class classification performance.
